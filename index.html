    <h2 class="sub-heading"># How to play</h2>
    <div class="para">
        In this game, we have layers of bricks and a ball to break the bricks. The player moves the paddle from left to
        right using keyboard to keep the ball from falling. A life is used when the player
        fails to hit the ball. A player has a maximum of 3 lives. A brick disappears when it’s
        hit by the ball. At the same time, there will be music outputs to match different game effects. There is a
        scoring system that reflects how efficient the user is to clear the bricks. Number of total paddle hits and
        maximum brick hits per trip are two of the possible factors.
